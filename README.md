A supermarket requires an information system to automate its management of products and
customers. A customer purchases products by filling a basket and taking the goods to a till or by
going on-line. On-line customers must register with the supermarket first before they can purchase
goods, otherwise you can assume that filling an e-basket and paying is the same as being
physically in-store.

When the goods are paid for the supermarket registers that the stock on the shelves has been
reduced and will automatically place an order with the supplier if the amount of goods fall below a
given threshold.

After processing the goods at the till (or on-line) the customer must pay. They enter their payment
details and the supermarket connects to a bank in order to make the transaction. The transaction
may be declined if the customer does not have sufficient funds
